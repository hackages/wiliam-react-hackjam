## How to learn with this hackjam ?

To start this hackjam first install all project's dependencies by running the command
`yarn install` or `npm install`.

You can see the `App` you are building by running the command `yarn start` or `npm start`. The app does not work right now, you need to fix it first.

All exercises instructions are under the folder [`instructions`](./instructions).

This HackJam is designed by Test Driven Learning, which means there are tests to guide you in the right direction. The more you succeed building the app the more green tests you will have. To run the tests you can type the command: `yarn test` or `npm test`.

Once all the tests are green, and you're satisfied with the quality of your code you can `commit` and `push` your current version. If you're not familiar with git here the procedure:
- First `add` the modification you've made with the command `git add src` (type this command at the project root folder)
- Then `commit` the modification with the command `git commit -m "Exercise complete !"`
- Then `push` the code using the command `git push origin` 

Once we've received your code we will check it and if all is good we will provide you the next exercise. To check the progression go to http://app.hackjam.io/ and go to `My HackJam` section.

If you're stuck somewhere, do not hesitate to go on http://app.hackjam.io/ or https://hackages.io/  and ask for help.

*Hope you'll enjoy and learn a lot !*
