Hey William, here is the extra exercise: 

# Exercise Bonus:

Instead of using callback to share data between parent component 
and child component, install, configure, use Redux to:

  1. [ ] Select the category
  2. [ ] Store the search Terms
  3. [ ] Filter the movies based on search terms and category
  4. [ ] Adding unit tests, and adapting existing ones is also required

The code can be pushed on exercise-12 branch.
(It will fail on the platform but no worries, that's expected)
