# Hackjam: Hackflix with React

Do not forget to read the [readme](../README.md) 

## Memento

- Launch the app `yarn start` or `npm start` and go to http://localhost:3000/
- Run the tests ! `yarn test` or `npm test` or `yarn start -- --watch` or `npm start  -- --watch` then press `a` to run all tests.
- Once your work done **commit** and **push** `git add src && git commit -m "Exercise completed" && git push origin`

## Exercise 8

It becomes a quite long file !
In this exercise you will create your first component.
We start small with the footer component. 
Just extract the footer into a component, then use it in the app component.

Do not forget to run the tests.

At the end of this exercise in [your app](http://localhost:3000) you should be able to:
- [ ] All test green
- [ ] Still show the footer
